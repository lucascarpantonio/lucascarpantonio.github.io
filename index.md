# Welcome to My Data Space  

Hi, I'm **Luca Scarpantonio** ðŸ§   

I combine a solid background in **pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality assurance** with a growing passion for **Python programming** and **Data Science**.  

In recent years, Iâ€™ve been expanding my curiosity toward **data**, **applied science**, and **quantitative analysis**.  
This site was born to share my first steps, experiments, and reflections as I explore this fascinating field.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here  

In these pages, I gather the projects Iâ€™ve been working on in my free time:  

- **Data analysis** of real-world datasets using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib  
- **Machine Learning experiments** and data visualization studies  
- **Automation tools** for improving process quality and efficiency  
- **Practical notes and insights** from my personal journey into data-driven thinking  

You wonâ€™t find perfect tutorials hereâ€”just real projects, born from curiosity and the desire to learn something new each time.

## An Invitation  

If youâ€™re also exploring the world of Data Science, I hope these pages can offer you ideas, practical examples, and maybe a bit of motivation.  

Learning to *read data* is a journey â€” and this is my way of documenting it, step by step.  

Take a look at the [**Projects**](../tabs/projects) section to discover my work,  
or visit [**About**](../tabs/about) to get to know me better.
