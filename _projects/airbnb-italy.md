A data-driven exploration of Venice’s short-term rental market.

The analysis focuses on:

- How listing prices vary across neighborhoods and seasons  
- The relationship between reviews, availability and pricing  
- Host behavior patterns (single-listing vs multi-listing hosts, activity over time)

The goal is to turn raw Airbnb data into an intuitive view of how the market in Venice really behaves.
