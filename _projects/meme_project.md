A small experimental project in Python for playing with simple automation and meme-style content generation.

The idea is to:

- Practice basic image and text manipulation in Python  
- Automate repetitive steps in creating simple visual content  
- Explore how small scripts can speed up creative experiments

It’s a lightweight sandbox project, useful as a playground while learning new libraries and techniques.
