Exploration of NASA’s Near-Earth Object dataset to uncover orbital trends, asteroid size distributions, and potential Earth impact risks.

In this project I:

- Clean and transform NEO observation data from NASA  
- Explore how size, distance and velocity are distributed  
- Visualize close-approach events to understand how often objects come near Earth

It’s a data-driven way to look at our cosmic neighborhood and make asteroid statistics more intuitive and visual.
