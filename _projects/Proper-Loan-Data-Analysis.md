An analysis of Prosper Marketplace’s peer-to-peer lending data — exploring how borrower profiles, credit ratings and income levels affect interest rates and loan performance.

Key angles explored:

- How Borrower APR varies with ProsperScore and income range  
- Which borrower segments receive larger loan amounts  
- How employment status relates to default and Chargedoff loans  

The project combines univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis to build an interpretable risk picture for consumer lending.
