A playful Python implementation of the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game, created as a project for Udacity’s *Introduction to Programming with Python II* course.

The project includes:

- A simple command-line interface for human vs. computer  
- Input validation and clear, user-friendly prompts  
- Basic game logic and score tracking across multiple rounds  

It’s a compact exercise focused on clean code, control flow and user interaction — a small but meaningful step in my Python learning path.
