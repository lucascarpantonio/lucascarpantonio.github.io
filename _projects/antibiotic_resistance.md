An exploratory and statistical analysis of antibiotic resistance patterns across bacterial strains.

This project focuses on:

- Cleaning and structuring lab data on bacterial isolates  
- Visualizing resistance profiles across multiple antibiotics  
- Highlighting critical combinations of drugs and pathogens with higher risk

The goal is to better understand multi-drug resistance trends and support data-informed decisions in healthcare and lab QA contexts.
