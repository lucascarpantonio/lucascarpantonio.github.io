I’m **Luca Scarpantonio** — a professional passionate about **data, analytics, and digital transformation**.  
With a background in **Quality Assurance and Data Integrity** within the pharmaceutical industry, I’ve spent the last decade bridging the gap between technical rigor and data-driven innovation.

My journey into **Data Science** began as a natural evolution of curiosity — exploring how Python, statistics, and visualization can turn raw data into meaningful insights.  
Over time, this curiosity became a concrete path: building automation tools, performing exploratory analyses, and developing small-scale dashboards that make data more accessible and actionable.

I believe in **learning by doing** — every project I share is both a study and a story, combining analytical precision with creative problem-solving.  

When I’m not working with data, I’m likely experimenting with new technologies, growing vegetables in my garden, or finding new ways to simplify everyday systems through code.
