# Blog Posts  

Welcome to my **Blog** section  

Here I share articles, experiments, and reflections about **Data Science**, **Python programming**, and the **digital transformation of quality systems**.  

Each post is a small step in an ongoing journey — learning, testing, and applying data-driven thinking to real-world problems.  
You’ll find stories from my projects, lessons learned, and practical insights that connect the world of **Quality Assurance** with **modern analytics** and **automation**.

### Featured Topics  
- **Python & Data Analysis** — tips, snippets, and applied scripts  
- **Data Visualization** — from exploratory insights to storytelling with plots  
- **Machine Learning & Modeling** — small experiments that bridge QA and AI  
- **Digital Quality & Compliance** — reflections on Data Integrity and process improvement

If you’re curious about how data can reshape decision-making in technical environments,  
this is the place where curiosity meets structure — and where I document that intersection.
